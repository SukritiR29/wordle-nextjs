# The Game of Wordle

Welcome to the Wordle game, a fun and challenging word-guessing game created with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. This project incorporates concepts from Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to provide an engaging gaming experience.

## Game Rules

- The player receives a hidden 5-letter word and has 6 guesses to find the target word.
- For each guess:
  - A letter that is in the target word but not in the same place turns yellow.
  - A letter in the guess word that is in the same place as the target word turns green.
  - Eliminated letters turn gray.

## Project Features

- **Random Word Selection**: A random 5-letter word is selected from the dictionary of English words stored in a JSON file.
- **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded feedback for each letter in the guess word based on its correctness and position.
- **Limited Guesses**: The player has 6 attempts to guess the target word.
- **User Interface**: Built with Next.js for a smooth and efficient web application. Tailwind CSS is used for styling to ensure a visually appealing interface.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js for a powerful and efficient development environment.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive design.
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Concepts from DSA applied to implement game logic.
- **Dictionary**: A JSON file containing a dictionary of all 5-letter English words.
